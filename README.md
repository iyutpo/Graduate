There are two analyses corresponding with two traffic conditions: 1. congested 2. uncongested

Reading sequence:

1. Two Matlab files: data preprocessing for congested and uncongested conditions.

2. uncongested.ipynb: data preprocessing before running random forest in R.

3. uncongested.R: random forest and partial dependence plots in R (H2O).

4. congested_R.R: random forest and partial dependence plots (2D and 3D) in R.

5. congested_analysis.ipynb: gradient boosting and partial dependence plots (2D and 3D) in Python.
